# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
This GitHub project is dedicated to building a robust house price prediction model using Python and machine learning techniques. Data Collected from Kaggle, I carefully preprocess a diverse dataset covering key housing attributes like location, size, bath, total sq_ft etc. Leveraging pandas, I ensure data quality and relevance for subsequent modeling.

The core of the project revolves around implementing and evaluating various regression algorithms using scikit-learn. Through systematic experimentation and cross-validation, I identify the most effective models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Rigorous parameter tuning and performance evaluation ensure model reliability.

Visualization plays a pivotal role in understanding data trends and model insights. Utilizing matplotlib and seaborn, I create informative visualizations to aid feature selection, model interpretation, and result presentation, enhancing project transparency.

In summary, this GitHub project offers a comprehensive exploration of house price prediction. It demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, performance evaluation, and deployment strategies. Whether you're a data enthusiast, real estate professional, or machine learning practitioner, this project provides valuable insights and practical knowledge for predictive analytics in real-world scenarios. 
the conlusion of project for house price prediction, crucial variables like area_type, size, location, and total_sqft were identified. Among algorithms, Gradient Boosting Regressor stood out as the optimal choice, demonstrating robust performance without overfitting or underfitting.
